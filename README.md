# Sonar-Data-Overlay-on-the-Orat-AUV

Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) play a crucial role in oceanographic research, industrial applications, and military operations. The ability to efficiently process and analyze sonar data is essential for underwater exploration. This project focuses on the colocation of Side-Scan Sonar (SSS) data with MultiBeam EchoSounder (MBES) bathymetry using data from the AURORA dataset and the ORAT AUV. The main goal is to prepare data for training machine learning models for semantic segmentation of benthic habitats.
